# Instagram_Basic_Display_API
The Instagram Basic Display API allows users of your app to get basic profile information, photos, and videos in their Instagram accounts.  The API can be used to access any type of Instagram account but only provides read-access to basic data. 

If you are building an app that will allow Instagram Businesses or Creators to publish media, moderate comments, identify @mentioned and hashtagged media, or get data about other Instagram users, use the Instagram Graph API instead.
